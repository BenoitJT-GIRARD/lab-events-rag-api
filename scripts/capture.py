"""Take this repository's screenshots, and write down what each one shows.

Destination: ``scripts/capture.py``.

A screenshot is the only image of a repository that cannot be regenerated from data. What
makes it checkable is the sentence next to it: which build was running, what had already
happened to the application, where the displayed data came from. This script takes the picture
and writes that sentence into ``docs/images/MANIFEST.json`` in the same gesture, because a
manifest filled in afterwards is filled in from memory.

The repository fills in :data:`CAPTURES` and nothing else. Each entry says what the image must
*prove*: « the API answers a prediction » names a surface, « a request with a missing feature
is refused with the field named » names a behaviour.

    uv run python scripts/capture.py                 # every capture
    uv run python scripts/capture.py --only api-docs
    uv run python scripts/capture.py --check         # take nothing, report what is stale

Two engines. Chrome headless is enough for a page that renders server-side or in one pass —
Swagger, Airflow, a static report — as long as ``--virtual-time-budget`` is given, without
which the picture is taken before the JavaScript has drawn anything. It is **not** enough for
a page whose content arrives over a websocket: a Streamlit page loads an empty skeleton and
fills it afterwards, and the virtual clock advances timers without waiting for that round
trip, so the capture comes out black however long the budget. Those pages go through
``playwright``, which waits for a selector that only exists once the content is there.
